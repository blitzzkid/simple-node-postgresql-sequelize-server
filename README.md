## Prerequisite

- PostgreSQL installed and running
- A database with name `test-db-1` is created (Currently the database connection string is hard-coded in the sequelize.js file. If you use a different database, you need to customise the connection string in that file.)

## Run

```
npm run install
node index.js
```
